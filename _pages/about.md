Hello! I am Freya Shah and I'm currently a final year student studying Computer Science with minor in Physics and Mathematics. 

I am interested in quantum computation and quantum information in general. Recently, I’ve developed a strong curiosity about the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. I'm fascinated by how quantum algorithms can enhance machine learning models and, conversely, how machine learning can be used to solve challenges in quantum simulation.

Outside the world of research and academia, I’m all about chasing sunsets, discovering new places, and diving into different cultures. I love getting creative with art and have recently acquired a new-found interest in cooking(sometimes). On top of that, I’m always up for a game of badminton. 

If you're looking for my CV, find a pdf [here](https://fs1132429.github.io/cv/). You can find some of my projects [here](https://fs1132429.github.io/projects/).
